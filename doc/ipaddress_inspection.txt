These are just some notes while I was inspecting python's ipadress module implementation
--> https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html

_IPAddressBase
    - its properties consume methods from its child's(_BaseV4), which is tied by
      IPv4Address
      You can call an _BaseV4 method from _BaseAddress class if the child inherits from
      both _BaseV4 and _BaseAddress
    - This is implemented more as a trait, as in, you should have all of the stuff
      I am using in some way or another
    + 'mother class'
    + properties (just getters)
    + classmethods

_BaseAddress(_IPAddressBase)
    + magic methods, lots of it

_BaseV4
    + bunch of classmethods
    + 2 properties getters, not setters
    

IPv4Address(_BaseV4, _BaseAddress)
    +
